# Kioptrix Level 1
## Discovery
- As always we start are search with netdiscover

- The IP of the machine is 192.168.1.104

## Information Gathering

### nmap
* We run the following nmap scan: nmap -A -Pn 192.168.1.104
  * -A is an aggressive scan, that enables script scanning (-sC), version detection (-sV), OS detection (-O) and traceroute (-traceroute)
  * -Pn disables ping discovery

Nmap has returned 6 ports:
* 22/TCP - default SSH port. Potential for SSH keys to be left on this box.
* 80/TCP - default port for HTTP web browsing. Hmm there may be a CMS here.
* 111/TCP - provides remote procedure call port mapping
* 139/TCP - netbios/samba, file sharing port. *Use smbmap, nbtlookup, nbtstat*
* 443/TCP - standard HTTPS web browsing port
* 1024/TCP - 
* The scrips results returned the NetBIOS name of the box: KIOPTRIX.

## Enumeration

Now that we have all listed all the ports, let's begin enumerating them. We'll start by simply going to the browser on port 80

### http

Browsed to the web page and we are presented with a test page. After inspecting the html, doesn't look like there's any leads present. Let's 
check out that samba port, 139

### samba

Earlier we found the hostname of the machine: KIOPTRIX. An nmblookup confirms this

Using nbtscan, we found the username, KIOPTRIX

Now, although we don't have a password, let's see if we can attempt to connect via SSH with the KIOPTRIX username. We received an error message:
*Unable to negotiate with 192.168.1.104 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1*
